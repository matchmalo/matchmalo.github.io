    What is the first marketing strategy you think of to promote a brand, product or service? There's no suspense! The
    first thing that comes to mind is "classic" paid advertising :
<ul>
    <li>Social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok...)</li>
    <li>Mass media (TV, radio, OOH, magazines etc...).</li>
</ul>
