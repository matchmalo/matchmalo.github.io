    What is the first marketing strategy you think of to promote a brand, product or service? There's no suspense! The
    first thing that comes to mind is "classic" paid advertising :
<ul>
    <li>Social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok...)</li>
    <li>Mass media (TV, radio, OOH, magazines etc...).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I enjoy discussing the marketing strategies adopted by brands. I am always surprised that many of them do not give
    any importance to partnership marketing.</p>

<p>They focus on competitive marketing. They forget that they can also join forces with others to create growth.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is partnership marketing ?</h2>

<p>
    Partnership marketing is a form of marketing that involves two or more companies combining their strengths to
    achieve a specific objective for each.<br>
    In other words, they will pool their resources and skills to increase their business.

<p>ü§ì For those addicted to mathematical formulas</p>

<p>In Partnership Marketing: 1 + 1 > 3</p>

<p>Partnership marketing is definitely low-cost or no-cost marketing. Whatever the term, the return on investment (ROI)
    is exponential. It's much higher than the performance generated by other acquisition channels. </p>

<p>Patience, you will see it in the following lines üòé. Let's first look at the benefits of this type of marketing.</p>

<p>
    <b>What are the benefits of partnership marketing ?</b>
<ul>
    <li>Reach your core target</li>
    <li>Boost your acquisition</li>
    <li>Discover and enter new markets</li>
    <li>Increase your brand awareness</li>
    <li>Build a relationship of trust with your clients</li>
    <li>Generate new revenue models</li>
    <li>Increase your retention rate</li>
    <li>Foster innovation</li>
    <li>Use the strengths of the competition to your advantage</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Just that ? üò≥ Hell, yes ! The superpower of partnership marketing is really underestimated. Some brands have
    understood its true value. They have put partnership at the heart of their marketing strategy. This strategy allows
    them to optimise their marketing budget with an incredible return on investment.</p>

<p>Would you like to know more about these brands? Here are some of them...</p>

<h2 class="section-heading mb-4">Some examples of partnership marketing</h2>

        <h4>Apple & Hermes</h4>
        <p>These two well-known brands have joined forces to create the Apple Watch Herm√®s or covers for smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Benefits for Apple</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Take advantage of Herm√®s' excellent know-how and reputation in the luxury industry.</li>
            <li>Reach fashionistas with high purchasing power and those who have not yet embraced smartwatches.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </di>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
        <p>
            <b>Benefits for Hermes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Apple's image of high-tech excellence to modernise itself.</li>
            <li>Reinforce its brand image with the modern touch provided by Apple.</li>
            <li>Reach a new, younger and trendier target.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
        <p>
            <b>Result</b><br>
            Both brands have created several high value products. <br>
            I bet the margin made on each product is much higher. Since the perceived value to the consumer is higher.
            So it is a way to sell the product even more expensive than it should be.

        <h4>Girlboss & Uber</h4>
        <p>Girlboss is a media company that aims to help women succeed in their careers, whether as employees or
            entrepreneurs.</p>

        <p>With a limited marketing budget, the startup decided to use partnership marketing as a growth lever. Hence
            the idea of teaming up with Uber.</p>

        <p>The two brands created an event to put on a unique event, Uber Pitch.</p>

        <p>It's a pitch and workshop for women entrepreneurs who have the opportunity to win $200,000 to launch their
            business.</p>
        <p><b>Benefits for Girlboss</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Find the funds to organise the event.</li>
            <li>Create high quality content for its audience.</li>
            <li>The fact that Uber (a trendy tech startup) accepted this partnership gives Girlboss real credibility.
            </li>
            <li>Boosting its notoriety by taking advantage of Uber's audience (see the image which is a story created by
                Uber on Instagram).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Benefits for Uber</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Reinforce its brand image. Despite its position as a startup that is revolutionizing the tech sector,
                Uber has found itself at the centre of numerous controversies that point to its corporate culture marked
                by sexual harassment and other misconduct. Partnering with a company like Girlboss has allowed it to
                rework its image. Especially with women. This partnership shows that it takes gender equality and
                diversity very seriously in its company.</li>
            <li>Regaining the trust of its female users.</li>
